RGB variables are floats bacuse they contain decimals. Integers only contain whole numbers, bools only contain true or false, and strings only contain text. The _bounce variable is a integer because you can't bounce something 1.5 times. You can't bounce by a decimal, crossing off floats. _bounce is counting the number of bounces, not whether of not it does bounce for example, so in this case bools don't work. And string is for text not counting. For step 1 of part 2, always end with a semi-colon to finish the line of code. For step 8, define the variable by giving it a type like float. These are the basic grammar and puncuation of code and how the computer can read and execute them.
